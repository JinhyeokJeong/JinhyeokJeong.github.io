Hello!

I'm Jin, a Ph.D. Candidate in Psychological Science (Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience) at Vanderbilt University. 
Under the mentorship of [Dr. Thomas Palmeri](http://catlab.psy.vanderbilt.edu/ 'Category Laboratory (CATLAB)'), I study computational mechanisms underlying visual cognition and perception, with a particular emphasis on ensemble perception and categorization. I am also interested in how computational cognitive modeling and psychometric modeling can be used to study computational mechanisms underlying visual cognition, and how a deep neural network can be combined with cognitive models.

I received B.A. in Psychology and M.S. in Cognitive Science from Yonsei University. During my master's studies, I worked with [Dr. Sang Chul Chong](https://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr 'Vision, Cognition, and Consciousness (VCC) Lab') to study ensemble perception, especially the perception of visual variance, using psychophysical methods.
