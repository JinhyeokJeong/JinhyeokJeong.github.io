<p style="font-size:0.8em;">Hello!</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em;">I'm Jin, a Ph.D. Candidate in Psychological Science (Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience) at Vanderbilt University. 
Under the mentorship of <a href="http://catlab.psy.vanderbilt.edu/" target="_blank" title="Category Laboratory (CATLAB)">Dr. Thomas Palmeri</a>, I study computational mechanisms underlying visual cognition and perception, with a particular emphasis on ensemble perception and categorization. I am also interested in how computational cognitive modeling and psychometric modeling can be used to study computational mechanisms underlying visual cognition, and how a deep neural network can be combined with cognitive models.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em;">I received a B.A. in Psychology and M.S. in Cognitive Science from Yonsei University. During my master's studies, I worked with <a href="https://vcc.yonsei.ac.kr" target="_blank" title="Vision, Cognition, and Consciousness (VCC) Lab">Dr. Sang Chul Chong</a> to study ensemble perception, especially the perception of visual variance, using psychophysical methods. </p>
